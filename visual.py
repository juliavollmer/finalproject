### Ideas/plan about the music to image:
### length of music piece determines the size of the final image
### Tones (frequences) determines the colors: --> further research on color organs
### Rhythm and breaks determines the position and distance of objects inside (be it geometrical or not)
### If music piece changes drastically or not will determine how much order the image has
### If possible, chords will determine the shape of objects, minor will be more sharp, while major more round 'soft'
### Volume determines the size of the objects
### A random value will determine the object itself, and thus make the image different each time
### If time allows, lyrics extraction could lead to another factor: incorparting the lyrics into the image
### Other values extracted from the music could be used to alter and manipulate the before created image.
